### Analysing Data from Wearable and Nearable Sensors
**Highlights**
- Visualized data from multiple different sensors during sleep
- PSG: EMG and activity
- Sensors: Emfit and Empatica
- Cross-correlated signals to compare activity signals from different sensors

### Social Media Analytics: Community Detection in Bipartite Networks
**Highlights**
- Implemented a Community Detection Algorithm from scratch to detect communities in a bipartite network of movie ratings and users
- Visualized samples of the graph showing the detected communities
