# 💼 Portfolio  

## Analysing Data from Wearable and Nearable Sensors  
**Goal:** Compare the performance of wearable and nearable sensors against EMG signals to assess their reliability in detecting motor activity during sleep.  
📌 **Tech Used:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MNE  
📌 **Outcome:** Performed cross-correlation analysis and visualized the relationship between wearable/nearable sensors and EMF signals, providing insights into sensor reliability for motor activity detection.
