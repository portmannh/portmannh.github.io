## My Projects

### Analysing Data from Wearable and Nearable Sensors  
Analysis of sleep activity data from 71 patients using Python, focusing on comparing wearable (Empatica E4 wristband) and nearable (Emfit QS bed sensors) devices against electromyography (EMG) from polysomnography (PSG) measurements
- Data Preprocessing:Signal cleaning, resampling, and normalization
- Feature Extraction: Extracting movement activity from accelerometer data and computing activity envelopes from EMG signals
- Cross-Correlation Analysis: Aligning wearable/nearable signals with PSG data based on peak correlation values, computing Pearson correlation coefficients, and visualizing relationships
- Data Visualization: Plotting time-series activity signals and overlaying aligned signals to assess sensor agreement
- Statistical Evaluation: Comparing correlation coefficients across devices to determine their reliability for motor activity detection

**Keywords:** time-series analysis, signal processing, signal alignment

### Social Media Analytics: Community Detection in Bipartite Networks
Implementation of a community detection algorithm for bipartite networks using movie-user data to uncover hidden patterns in how users rate and review movies, revealing shared preferences or common characteristics among groups of users and movies
- Algorithm Implementation: Researching and implementing the Bilouvain algorithm
- Visualization: Creating graphs showing community structures by utilizing Python's NetworkX library

**Keywords:** network analysis, community detection, data visualization

### Multimodal Text Editor
Development of a multimodal text editor that integrates speech recognition and eye-tracking to assist individuals with motor disabilities in text input and formating
- Text Editor Development: Building the original text editor based on an open-source project, adapting it for multimodal interaction
- System Integration: Combined speech recognition,eye-tracking, and the text editor into a cohesive system, deployed via a Flask web application
- User Testing & Evaluation: Coduction of usability text, collecting feedback for further improvements

**Keywords:** multimodal system, text editor
